day_of_month(date)

day_of_year(date)

days_remaining(date)

week_of_month(date, first_day = "Monday")

\arguments{
\item{date}{A vector of Gregorian dates}

\item{numeric}{Logical. Return a numeric vector if TRUE with 1 denoting the \code{first_day}}

\item{first_day}{Character denoting first day of the week. Ignored if \code{numeric} is \code{FALSE}.
Default is \code{"Monday"}}

\description{

}
\details{
\code{week_of_year()} returns the ISO 8601 week number with \code{first_day} as Monday.
Under this standard, week 1 of a year is defined as the first week with at least 4 days in the year;
equivalently, it is the week  containing 4 January. There is no week 0; instead week 1 of a year may
begin in the previous calendar year.

\code{week_of_month()} is defined analogously where week 1 of a month is the first week with at least
4 days in the month; equivalently, it is the week containing the 4th day of the month. There is no week 0;
instead week 1 of a month may begin in the previous calendar month.

\code{days_remaining()} returns the number of days remaining in the year. Other functions should be
self-explanatory.
