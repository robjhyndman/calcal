The goal of calcal is to do calendrical calculations, based on the algorithms described in Reingold and
    Dershowitz (2018) <doi:10.1017/9781107415058>.

## Installation

You can install the development version of calcal from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

```

## Example

```{r example}
library(calcal)
today <- Sys.Date()
as_rd(today)
as_gregorian(today)
as_julian(today)
```
