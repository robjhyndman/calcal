The goal of calcal is to do calendrical calculations, based on the algorithms described in [Reingold and
    Dershowitz (2018) *Calendrical Calculations*, 4th edition, Cambridge University Press](https://doi.org/10.1017/9781107415058).

It is largely a translation of the Lisp code produced by Reingold and Dershowitz for [Calendrica 4.0](https://github.com/EdReingold/calendar-code2).

## Installation

You can install the development version of calcal from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("robjhyndman/calcal")
```

## Example

Dates in multiple calendars:

```{r example}
library(calcal)
library(tibble)
library(tidyr)
library(dplyr)
tibble(
  Gregorian = gregorian_date(1990, 2, 20) + 1:10,
  ISO = as_iso(Gregorian),
  Chinese = as_chinese(Gregorian),
  Islamic = as_islamic(Gregorian),
  Hebrew = as_hebrew(Gregorian)
)
```

Some religious and cultural holidays

```{r holidays}
tibble(
  year = 2025:2029,
  # Christian holidays
  Easter = easter(year),
  `Orthodox Easter` = orthodox_easter(year),
  Christmas = christmas(year),
  `Orthodox Christmas` = orthodox_christmas(year),
  # Jewish holidays
  `Rosh Hashanah` = rosh_hashanah(year),
  Passover = passover(year),
  `Yom Kippur` = yom_kippur(year),
  Sukkot = sukkot(year),
  Hanukkah = hanukkah(year),
  # Islamic holidays
  Ramadan = ramadan(year),
  `Eid al-Fitr` = eid_al_fitr(year),
  `Eid al-Adha` = eid_al_adha(year),
  # Baháʼí holidays
  `Birth of the Bab` = birth_of_the_bab(year),
  `Naw Ruz` = naw_ruz(year),
  `Feast of Ridvan` = feast_of_ridvan(year),
  # Chinese Holidays
  `Chinese New Year` = chinese_new_year(year),
  `Dragon Festival` = dragon_festival(year),
  `Qing Ming` = qing_ming(year)
) |>
  pivot_longer(-year) |>
  pivot_wider(names_from = year, values_from = value) |>
  arrange(`2025`)
```
